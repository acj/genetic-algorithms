# genetic-algorithms

When I'm learning a new programming language, one of the first non-trivial programs I write is a
[genetic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm). GAs call for custom types,
collections, loops, string manipulation, floating point math, decent code organization, and
(optionally) concurrency. There's just enough complexity to force me into the weeds and get to know
the language.

This repository is a collection of such programs. They should mostly work, but I don't recommend using them for anything important.
